\MYTITLE{Lab 9 for Sections 03 and 04 \\ 6 November 2014\\
Due Thursday, 13 November by 2:30pm }

\vspace{-0.2in}
\subsection*{Objectives}
\vspace{-0.05in}

To enhance your experience with designing and implementing your own Java classes, including the completion of tasks such
as picking the right the instance variables and creating both the constructors and the methods.  Additionally, to practice
using compound {\tt if/else} statements as part of a solution to a real-world problem involving a popular and well-known
game.

\vspace{-0.15in}
\subsection*{General Guidelines for Labs}
\vspace{-0.05in}

\begin{itemize}
\item
{\bf Work on the Alden Hall computers.} If you want to work on a different
machine, be sure to transfer your programs to the Alden
machines and re-run them before submitting.
\item
  {\bf Update your repository often!} You should {\tt add}, {\tt commit}, 
  and {\tt push} your updated files each time you work on them.  I will not grade 
your programs until the due date has passed.
\item
{\bf Review the Honor Code policy.} You
may discuss programs with others, but programs that are nearly identical
to others will be taken as evidence of violating the Honor Code.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{-0.15in}
\subsection*{Reading Assignment}
\vspace{-0.05in}

To continue to learn more about {\tt if/else if/else} statements and boolean expressions, please again review Sections
5.1--5.3. Since this assignment will also require you to continue to use Java classes and methods, you should once again
review Sections 4.1--4.5.  To best prepare for the new content in this laboratory assignment, you should also study 
Sections 5.1--5.6, paying particularly close attention to the material about {\tt while} loops, {\tt break} and {\tt
  continue} statements, iterators, and the {\tt java.util.ArrayList} class. Students who are not familiar with
text-based todo list management tools are encouraged to review, as an example, \url{http://todotxt.com/}.

\vspace{-0.1in}
\subsection*{Create a New Directory and Two Java Programs}
\vspace{-0.05in}

In your own {\tt cs111F2014-<your user name>} repository inside the {\tt labs/} directory, create a directory called
{\tt lab8}. Type ``{\tt cd lab8}'' to move to the new directory. Then, using {\tt gvim}, you should create {\tt
  SudokuChecker.java} and {\tt SudokuCheckerMain.java} files that will store your solution to this laboratory
assignment. Remember to use the Java program template from a previous lab!

\subsection*{Implementing a Sudoku Checker}

SUDOKU GRID IS VALID!
\end{verbatim}

\vspace{-0.2in}
\subsection*{Required Deliverables}
\vspace{-0.05in}

For this assignment you are invited to submit electronic versions of the following deliverables through both the Bitbucket
repository and in a signed and printed format.

\vspace{-0.05in}
\begin{enumerate}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
  \item Completed and properly formatted {\tt SudokuChecker.java} and {\tt SudokuCheckerMain.java} files.

  \item An output file containing outputs obtained from running {\tt SudokuCheckerMain} five times.
        
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{-0.05in}

\noindent As you complete this step, you should make sure that you created a {\tt lab9/} directory within your Git
repository.  Then, you can save all of the required deliverables in the {\tt lab9/} directory---please see the course
instructor or a teaching assistant if you are not able to create your directory properly. 

\noindent In addition to turning in signed and printed copies of your code and output, share your source code and the output
file with me through your Git repository by correctly using ``{\tt git add}'', ``{\tt git commit}'', and ``{\tt git
  push}'' commands. When you are done, please ensure that the Bitbucket Web site has a {\tt lab9/} directory in your
repository with the two Java files in the list of deliverables and the {\tt output} file. Please see the instructor
if you have questions about assignment submission.

% In addition to turning in signed and printed copies of your code and output, please share your program and the output
% file with me through your Git repository by correctly using the ``{\tt git add}'', ``{\tt git commit}'', and ``{\tt git
% push}'' commands. When you are done, please ensure that the Bitbucket Web site has a {\tt lab8/} directory in your
% repository with the four files called {\tt Lab8.java}, {\tt Lab8Main.java}, and {\tt output}. You
% should see the instructor or a teaching assistant if you have questions about submitting this assignment.

In adherence to the Honor Code, students should complete this assignment on an individual basis. While it is appropriate
for students in this class to have high-level conversations about the assignment, it is necessary to distinguish
carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others and the student who produces
assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else's work.  Deliverables that are nearly identical
to the work of others will be taken as evidence of violating the \mbox{Honor Code}.
