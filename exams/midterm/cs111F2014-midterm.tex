\item {\bf [8 points]}
Write a complete Java program that does the following: 
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Prints your name and the date. 
\item Prints a message telling the user to type a word. 
\item Reads in a single word typed by the user at the keyboard. 
\item Prints the word back out. 
\end{itemize}
You do \underline{not} need to include 
comments explaining the purpose of each line of code.
However, all other parts of the program must be
there---the class, the main method, the ``\{'' and ``\}'' characters,
the {\tt import} statements, and all other relevant Java components.

Please try to be neat; please try to align things like ``\{'' and ``\}''
characters; please try to clearly distinguish between upper-case and
lower-case letters (so that I will know, for instance, whether
you wrote ``{\tt system}'' with a small ``{\tt s}'' or ``{\tt System}''
with a capital ``{\tt S}'').

What GVim and/or Linux commands would you use to perform the following tasks? 
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
\item Create a new directory named {\tt midterm} within your current directory.
\item Make {\tt midterm/} the new current directory (i.e., ``move into'' the {\tt midterm/} directory).
\item Start GVim and insert the {\tt Template.java} into the {\tt Midterm.java} file.
\item Compile and run the {\tt Midterm} class in the terminal window.

\item {\bf [6 points]}
At one of Meadville's fancy restaurants, a cup of tea costs
\$3. You have a certain number of dollars, stored in an {\tt int}
variable named {\tt cash}. Write the Java statements needed to
print out the maximum number of cups of tea you can purchase,
together with how much cash you will have left after purchasing them.
These should be printed with simple labels, e.g., ``{\tt Cups of tea:}'' 
and ``{\tt Amount left:}'' or similar labels of your choice.

You do not have to write a complete program. You do not need to declare
the variable {\tt cash}---it has already been declared and assigned a
value. All you need to do is determine the two quantities described
above and print them out,
assuming the cost of a cup of tea is \$3.

Which of the following are allowable as possible variable names in your Java program? Circle all that are allowable.
For this question the definition of the word ``allowable'' is that the variable name will not cause the Java compiler to produce an
error or a warning.

\item {\bf [6 points]} Fill in the missing statement or statements to set variable {\tt x} to a random integer between
  -5 (inclusive) and 5 (exclusive).  This means that {\tt x} should include the value of -5 but exclude the value of 5
  and thus take on a number in the range -5, -4, -3, \ldots, 4. You should also set variable {\tt y} to a random {\tt
    float} value between 0.0 (inclusive) and 6.0 (exclusive). As such, this means that {\tt y} must take on a number in
  the range 0.0, \ldots, 5.999999. Finally, your program should use a {\tt Math} static method to print out the maximum
  value of either {\tt x} or 0.

  distinct diagrams.
